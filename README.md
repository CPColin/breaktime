Need a break? Need a reminder? Run this application and enjoy your excuse to spend X seconds of
every Y minutes taking it easy in the name of your health!

This application adds an icon to your system tray that gradually fills up every thirty minutes and
reminds you to take a break. It resets if your screen turns totally black for around thirty seconds
or if you right-click the icon and choose the "Reset" option.

Hint: Use `ceylon fat-jar com.crappycomic.breaktime` to bundle this thing into a fat JAR that
you can then run on startup, so you don't forget to take a break!
